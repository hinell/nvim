## Open-Source, not Open-Contribution
This library is open-source, meaning that you can make as many copies of it as you want and do whatever you want with those copies as long as you don't trying to commercialize it, but it is NOT open to contribution. In order to keep this library in the public domain and ensure that the code does not become contaminated with proprietary or licensed content, the project does not accept patches from people who have not submitted an affidavit dedicating their contribution into the public domain.

All of the code in it is original, having been written specifically for use by it. No code has been copied from unknown sources on the internet.
